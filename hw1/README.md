# Homework1 for ENPM673  

## Problem2  
Problem2 is to use standard least squares method to find the best fit curve of the video1 and video2  
To run the code, first make sure the ball_video1.mp4 and ball_video2.mp4 are under the same file with Problem2.py  
Then open the terminal under the file and type
```bash
python Problem2.py  
```  
ps. test.py is to test the contours whether capture the edge of the ball  
The result of the Problem2 would be  
![](<Problem2.png>)  
  
## Problem3
Problem3 implements linear least square method, total least square method, and RANSAC to compare with each other  
Also compute the covariance matrix and plot the eigenvectors on the graph  
To run the code, first make sure the Problem3_data.csv is under the same file with Problem3.py  
Then open the terminal under the file and type  
```bash
python Problem3.py
```  
The result of the Problem3 would be  
![](<Problem3.png>)  
  
## Problem4  
Problem4 is to compute SVD method without inbuilt function  
To run the code, the terminal should be opened under the file and type  
```bash
python Problem4.py
```  

## Environment  
Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04  
Python 3.7
